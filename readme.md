# Apple Stock Price Prediction

This project presents an innovative approach to predicting Apple Inc.'s stock prices by combining linear regression with deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The aim is to leverage both long-term and short-term prediction capabilities to minimize errors in stock price forecasting.

## Project Aim

The primary objective of this project is to develop a hybrid modeling framework that integrates traditional linear regression with advanced deep learning methods. By utilizing LSTM and RNN, the model captures temporal dependencies in the stock price data, allowing for more accurate predictions that consider both immediate market fluctuations and longer-term trends.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Model**: Combines linear regression for baseline predictions with LSTM and RNN for capturing complex patterns in time series data.
- **Error Minimization**: Focuses on achieving the least prediction error by integrating short-term and long-term forecasting strategies.
- **Data Analysis**: Provides insights into stock price movements and trading volumes, facilitating informed investment decisions.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of the stock record.
- **Adj Close**: The adjusted closing price of the stock.
- **Close**: The closing price of the stock.
- **High**: The highest price of the stock on that day.
- **Low**: The lowest price of the stock on that day.
- **Open**: The opening price of the stock on that day.
- **Volume**: The number of shares traded.
