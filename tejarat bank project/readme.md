Bank Account Recommendation Model
Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model designed to assist banks in identifying customers who may benefit from a special account based on their personal and account information. The model leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze various features and provide actionable recommendations.

Model Performance
The model's performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, which is a robust measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.78, indicating a strong predictive capability. This score suggests that the model is effective in identifying potential candidates for special accounts, thereby aiding the bank in enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing account offerings.

Key Features
Personal Information Analysis: The model considers various personal attributes such as age, income, and employment status to make informed recommendations.
Account Information Utilization: It also takes into account account-related data, including transaction history, account balance, and account tenure.
Deep Learning Architecture: The model employs a sophisticated neural network architecture to capture complex patterns and relationships within the data.
