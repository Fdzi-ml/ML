BBC News Article Classification
This project aims to classify BBC news articles into various categories such as business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech. The classification leverages natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the text data for analysis and modeling. In this project, we utilize the spaCy library to process the text and filter out ineffective words that may not contribute meaningfully to the classification task. Specifically, we remove the following parts of speech:

Adjectives (ADJ): Words that describe nouns, which can introduce bias and subjective interpretations.
Adverbs (ADV): Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, often adding unnecessary complexity.
Numbers (NUM): Numerical values that may not provide valuable context in the classification of textual content.
Code Implementation
Below is the code snippet used to filter out these ineffective words:

Copy
import spacy

def is_noun(text):
    # Load the English model
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    
    # Process the input text
    doc = nlp(" ".join(text))
    
    # List to hold nouns
    noun = []
    
    # Iterate through tokens and append only nouns to the list
    for token in doc:
        if token.pos_ not in ['ADJ', 'ADV', 'NUM']:
            noun.append(token.text)
    
    return noun
Explanation of the Code
Loading spaCy's English Model: The function begins by loading the English language model, which is essential for part-of-speech tagging.

Processing Text: The input text is processed to create a doc object, which contains the tokens (words) in the text.

Filtering Tokens: The function iterates through each token in the processed document. It checks the part of speech of each token and appends it to the noun list only if it is not an adjective, adverb, or number.

Returning Nouns: Finally, the function returns a list of nouns, effectively filtering out the specified parts of speech.

Importance of Filtering
By removing adjectives, adverbs, and numbers, we aim to enhance the quality of the features used for classification. This helps in reducing noise in the data and allows the model to focus on the more relevant content of the articles, thereby improving classification accuracy.
